# Home Assistant Add-on: S3 Backup

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the [internal mqtt broker](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) activated or have an external mqtt server
- Mare sure you have the MQTT Integration activated (same link as above)
- Make sure you have public and private GPG Key + Passphrase in place


If not - here is how to generate it

1. Make sure you have a linux box around or install the [visual studio code addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-vscode/blob/main/README.md) an start a terminal in there

```

gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.40; Copyright (C) 2022 g10 Code GmbH

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

gpg: /root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: directory '/root/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d' created
gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/root/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/5F7C581AE8FF77856C625B855D2BACF61ED7F9DF.rev'
public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa3072 2024-10-30 [SC] [expires: 2026-10-30]
      5F7C581AE8FF77856C625B855D2BACF61ED7F9DF
uid                      Your Name <you@yourdomain.com>
sub   rsa3072 2024-10-30 [E] [expires: 2026-10-30]
```

> Notice the above key id 5F7C581AE8FF77856C625B855D2BACF61ED7F9DF in the output.  
> In the below example commands, you need to replace the keyid with YOUR key id!

1.1 If gpg is not installed in your instance do the following and repeat step 1

```
 apt update
 apt install gpg
```

2. After successful generation, export the keys in pem format with _YOUR_ given key-id in the output

```
gpg -a --output public.pem --export 5F7C581AE8FF77856C625B855D2BACF61ED7F9DF
```

3. And same for the private key. GPG will ask you for a passphrase which protects your private key. You need the passphrase later on.

```
gpg -a --output private.pem --export-secret-key 5F7C581AE8FF77856C625B855D2BACF61ED7F9DF
```
4. Last, copy both files on your homeassistant instance into the /ssl folder

ThatÂ´s all - all prerequisites are set! Congrats!

## Options

### S3 Bucketname (s3settings_bucketName)
Specify the bucket the backup go in.  
You will need to create this bucket upfront within your S3.  
The bucketname is without any slashes

### S3 Endpoint URL (s3settings_endpointUrl)
Specify the full URL of your S3 hoster.  
This is the URL without the bucketname.  
The base URL of your S3 server without trailing slash.

### S3 AccessKey (s3settings_accessKey)
Specify your access_key.  
Make sure you have granted access to the above bucket

### S3 SecretKey (s3settings_secretKey)
Specify your secret_key.  
Make sure you have granted access to the above bucket

### GPG Fingerprint (gpgsettings_fingerprint)
The fingerprint id of your public key.  
This is the above mentions key-id which you can find in the output of the key-gen.  
If you have forgotten it, you can get it again with:   
```
gpg --list-keys
```

### GPG Passphrase (gpgsettings_passphrase)
The passphrase your private key is protected with.  
See above documentation!

### GPG Public Key Filename (gpgsettings_publicKey)
The filename under /ssl of your public key.

### GPG Private Key Filename (gpgsettings_privatKey)
The filename under /ssl of your private key.

### Duplicity SourceDir (duplicitysettings_sourceDir)
This should typically contain /backup.

### Duplicity RestoreDir (duplicitysettings_restoreMediaDir)
I decided that it is better to restore the backup in an own folder.  
The base folder is /media.  
You can here specify the restore folder without any slashes!

### Duplicity IncrementFor (duplicitysettings_incrementalFor)
Time to increment before making a new full backup.
This is transfered to duplicity option: full-if-older-than.   
The allowed time formats are: D, W, M, or Y

### Duplicity Remove Older Than (duplicitysettings_removeOlderThan)
Removing older backups from S3.
This is transfered to duplicity options: remove-older-than 
The allowed time formats are: D, W, M, or Y

### Use internal MQTT (mqttsettings_use_internal)
Switch this on to use the internal mqtt server.
With this option the username and password is auto injected.

### MQTT Server Name/IP (mqttsettings_server)
The hostname or IP of your external (non-homeassistnat) mqtt server. Connection will be done on port 1883.

### MQTT Username (mqttsettings_user)
The mqtt user you created

### MQTT Password (mqttsettings_pass)
